Quick update on the Baby Piano Android app. I have uploaded it to Google Play, woohoo!

However I chose to put it as 'Alpha Test' as I want to still check it works and looks OK on 7 and 10 inch tablets and make sure it is solid enough for a full release.

If you want to try it now just join this Google Plus Community:

And then you can access the app via this link:

Update 2014-07-08, it is now live, here:
