I was never into running or any kind of exercise or sport as a kid, choosing "Snooker" as an option in physical education was my idea of being smart. However now I am grown up I realised that I need to exercise more just to be able to keep up with the pace of work life, family life. So I enrolled in [City 2 Surf][1] and completed my first running race of any kind.

If you live in Sydney you have heard of it. For those who haven't it is an awesome run, with 80,000 people starting in the city and making their way at various speeds to Bondi Beach along 14km of road. Lots of music and high-fives on the way. And some heart-breaking hills just to mess everyone up!

I trained for 10 weeks of which I was sick for 2 but luckily feeling good for the day! I did good time (by my standards) that I am proud of, and it is something I will try to beat next year.

My quads are sore, so I am going to have a week off, and then think about the next challenge. I sometimes read [Andy Males'][2] blog and I know he runs alot and seems to love it - so hopefully he'll be proud of me for taking this first step into running and training for it.
