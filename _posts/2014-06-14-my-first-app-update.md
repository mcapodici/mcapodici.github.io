I have completed the app to a level where it is ready to submit, although there are improvements I could make to both the user experience and the quality of code.

Here is a video (very unfortunately without sound - I will update if I can record one with sound) of the app.

Notice I got the adverts in. Very important!

I now need to learn about the app store optimisation I mentioned in the previous post, in order to submit this with the best possible chance.
